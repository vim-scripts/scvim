Ptpar embed event streams in parallel, with time offset

superclass: ListPatterns

Embeds several event streams so that they form a single output stream with 
all their events in temporal order, providing a global offset for each. 
When one stream ends, the other streams are further embedded until all have ended.

Ptpar(list, repeats)
 
 list: list of pairs of times and patterns: [time, pat, time, pat .. ]
 repeats: repeat the whole pattern n times (default: 1)




// see the delta values in the resulting events
(
var a, b, c, t;
a = Pbind(\x, Pseq([1, 2, 3, 4]), \dur, 1);
b = Pbind(\x, Pseq([10, 20, 30, 40]), \dur, 0.4);
c = Ptpar([0.0, a, 1.3, b]);
t = c.asStream;
20.do({ t.next(Event.default).postln; });
)

// sound example
(
var a, b;
a = Pbind(\note, Pseq([7, 4, 0], 4), \dur, Pseq([1, 0.5, 1.5], inf));
b = Pbind(\note, Pseq([5, 10, 12], 4), \dur, 1);
Ptpar([ 0.0, a, 1.3, b ]).play;
)
