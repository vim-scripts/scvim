Symbols are represented syntactically as literals which are described in [01 Literals] .

Math

Symbols respond to all unary and binary math operations by returning themselves.
The result of any math operation between a Number or other math object and a Symbol
is to return the Symbol. This allows operations on lists of notes which contain 'rest's
to preserve the rests.
