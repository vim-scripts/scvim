TestCase						Unit Testing


Rather than write full classes that test each method of your class, this uses a simple instance.

TestCase(Object,
	'==' -> {
		var a;
		a = Object.new;
		a == a // test passes if it returns true
	}
);

TestCases for each class can be stored in "TestingAndToDo/Tests" as Classname.test.rtf (note that if you check "hide extension" it will just say Classname.test).

Any class can find and run its test:

	Float.test;
	
If not found, a message is posted.

All classes can try and run their tests if they have them:

	TestCase.runAll;
	
An individual test case that you are working on can be run:

	TestCase(Object,
		'!==' -> {
			var a;
			a = Object.new;
			a !== a // a deliberate failure
		}
	).run;

You can click to open the class file or the test file.
