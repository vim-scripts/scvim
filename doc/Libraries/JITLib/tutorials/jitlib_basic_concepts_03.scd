proxyspace - basic concepts 			3



internal structure of the node proxy, node order and the parameter context

a) slots
b) fadeTime
b) play/stop, send/release, pause/resume, clear
c) the parameter context


A NodeProxy has two internal contexts in which the objects are inserted:
The group, which is on the server, and the nodeMap, which is a client side
parameter context. As the group can contain an order of synths, there is
a client side representation, in which the source objects are stored (see Order).

// make new space
p = ProxySpace.push(s.boot);
~z.play; ~y.ar; // explicitly initialize proxies



a) NodeProxy slots:

One node proxy can hold several objects in an execution order. The index can be any positive integer.

// the initial slot (0) is used when assigning directly.
// ~y is still unused, we will add it later.

~z = (~y * pi).sin * 0.1 * { LFSaw.kr(LFNoise1.kr(0.1 ! 3).sum * -18).max(0.2) };

// other slot numbers are accessed by positive integers:

~y[1] = {Saw.ar([400, 401.3], 0.4) };
~y[0] = {Saw.ar([300, 301], 0.4) };

// to remove one of them, nil is used:

~y[0] = nil;

// what is to be found at index 1?
~y[1] // a playing interface
~y[1].source.postcs // the function that was put in.
~y.source; // this returns objects in the slots.


multiple assignment

// the function is assigned to th slots from 1 to 4
~z[1..4] = { SinOsc.ar(exprand(300, 600), 0, LFTri.kr({exprand(1, 3)} ! 3).sum.max(0)) * 0.1 };


// the function is assigned to the slots 1, 2 and 3 (subsequent)
~z[1..] = [ {SinOsc.ar(440) * 0.1 }, { SinOsc.ar(870) * 0.08 }, { SinOsc.ar(770) * 0.04 }];

// if no slot is given, all other slots are emptied
~z = {OnePole.ar(Saw.ar([400, 401.3], 0.3), 0.95) };

~z.end;
~y.end;



b) fade time:

// setting the fadeTime will allow cross fades.
// in case of an audio rate proxy the fade is pseudo-gaussian
// in case of a control rate proxy it is linear.

~z.play;

~z.fadeTime = 5.0; // 5 seconds
~z = { max(SinOsc.ar([300, 301]), Saw.ar([304, 304.3])) * 0.1 };
~z = { max(SinOsc.ar(ExpRand(300, 600)), Saw.ar([304, 304.3])) * 0.1 };

// the fadeTime can be set effectively at any time
~z.fadeTime = 0.2;
~z = { max(SinOsc.ar(ExpRand(3, 160)), Saw.ar([304, 304.3])) * 0.1 };



note that the fadeTime is also used for the operations xset and xmap.(see below)



c) play/stop, send/free, pause/resume

there are a couple of messages a NodeProxy understands that are related to play, stop etc.
Here is what they do.

play/stop
	
	this pair of messages is related to the monitoring function of the proxy.
	play starts monitoring, stop ends the monitoring.
	if the proxy group is playing (this can be tested with .isPlaying), play will not
	affect the proxie's internal behaviour in any way. Only if it is not playing (e.g because
	one has freed the group by cmd-period) it starts the synths/objects in the proxy.
	Stop never affects the internal state of the proxy.
	
	// first hit cmd-period.
	~z = { max(SinOsc.ar(ExpRand(3, 160)), Saw.ar([304, 304.3])) * 0.1 };
	~z.play;	// monitor the proxy
	~z.stop; // note that now the proxy is still playing, but only in private
	~z.isPlaying; // is the group playing? yes.
	~z.monitor.isPlaying; // is the monitor playing? no.
	
	You can pass a vol argument to play to adjust the monitor volume without
	affecting the proxy internal bus volume.
	
	~z.play(vol:0.3);
	// while playing you can set the volume also:
	~z.vol = 0.8;
	

send / release
	
	this pair of messages controls the synths within the proxy. It does not
	affect the monitoring (see above). send starts a new synth, release releases the synth.
	send by default releases the last synth. if the synth frees itself (doneAction 2) spawn can be used.
	
	// first hit cmd-period.
	~z.play; // monitor. this starts also the synth, if the group wasn't playing.
	
	~z = { SinOsc.ar(ExpRand(20, 660) ! 2) * Saw.ar(ExpRand(200, 960) ! 2) * 0.1 };
	
	~z.release; // release the synth. the current fadeTime is used for fade out
	
	~z.send; // send a new synth. the current fadeTime is used for fade in
	
	~z.send; // send another synth, release the old
	
	~z.release;

	~z.stop;
	
	~z.play; // monitor. as the group was still playing, this does _not_ start the proxy.
	
	in order to free the synths and the group together, free is used:
	
	~z.free; // this does also not affect the monitoring.
	~z.play; // monitor. as the group was not playing, this starts the proxy.

	
	in order to free the synths and the group, stop playback, end is used.
	
	~z.end(3); // end in 3 sec
	
	in order to rebuild the synthdef on the server, use rebuild.
	this can make sense when the synthdef has a statistic architecture (but of course this is far less efficient than send)
	
	(
	~z = {
		sum(
			SinOsc.ar(Rand(300,400) + ({exprand(1, 1.3)} ! rrand(1, 9)))
			* LFCub.ar({exprand(30, 900)} ! rrand(1, 9))
			* LFSaw.kr({exprand(1.0, 8.0)} ! rrand(1, 9)).max(0)
			* 0.1
		)
	};
	)
	
	~z.play;
	~z.rebuild;
	~z.send;	// send just creates a new synth
	~z.rebuild; // rebuild the synthdef
	~z.end;
	
	
	

pause / resume
	when paused, a node proxy still stays active, but every synth that is started is paused until
	the proxy is resumed again.

	~z.play;
	
	~z.pause; // pause the synth.
	
	~z = { SinOsc.ar({ExpRand(300, 660)} ! 2) * 0.1 }; 	// you can add a new function,
												// which is paused.
	
	~z.resume; // resume playing.
	
	
	Note that pause/resume causes clicks with audio rate proxies, which do not
	happen when pauseing control rate proxies.
												

	
clear	

	clear removes all synths, the group, the monitor and releases the bus number.

	~z.clear;
	~z.bus; 		// no bus
	~z.isNeutral; // not initialized.
	
	note that when other processes use the nodeproxy these are not notified. So clearing has to
	be done with regard to this.









d) The parameter context


what happens to function arguments?

	~y.play;
	~y = { arg freq=500; SinOsc.ar(freq * [1, 1.1]) * 0.1 };
	
now the argument 'freq' is a control in the synth (just like in SynthDef) which you can change by the 'set' message.

	~y.set(\freq, 440);
	
	// unlike in synths, this context is kept and applied to every new synth:

	~y = { arg freq=500; Formant.ar(50, freq * [1, 1.1], 70) * 0.1 };

xset is a variant of set, to crossfade the change using the current fadeTime:

	~y.fadeTime = 3;
	~y.xset(\freq, 600);
	
	// the same context is applied to all slots:

	~y[2] = { arg freq=500; SinOsc.ar(freq * [1, 1.1]) * LFPulse.kr(Rand(1, 3)) * 0.1 };
	~y.xset(\freq, 300);

	
the parameter context also can keep bus mappings. a control can be mapped to any control proxy:

	~c = { MouseX.kr(300, 800, 1) };
	~y.map(\freq, ~c);
	
	// also here the context is kept:

	~y = { arg freq=500; Formant.ar(4, freq * [1, 1.1], 70) * 0.1 };


xmap is a variant of map, to crossfade the change using the current fadeTime:
	
	~y.set(\freq, 440);
	~y.xmap(\freq, ~c);


to remove a setting or a mapping, use unmap / unset.
	
	~y.unmap;
	

	
a multichannel control can be mapped to a multichannel proxy using mapn:

	~c2 = { [MouseX.kr(300, 800, 1), MouseY.kr(300, 800, 1)] };
	~y = { arg freq=#[440, 550]; SinOsc.ar(freq) * SinOsc.ar(freq + 3) * 0.05 };
	~y.mapn(\freq, ~c2);


the parameter context can be examined:

	~y.nodeMap;

	// apart from the parameters explicitly set,
	// it contains the bus index and the fadeTime
	
	// for more information, see NodeMap


p.clear(8); // clear the whole proxy space, in 8 secs.
