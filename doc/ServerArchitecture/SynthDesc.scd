SynthDescdescription of a synth definition


contains information about a SynthDef, such as its name, its control names and default values.
also information is provided of its outputs and inputs and whether it has a gate control.



*read(path, keepDefs, dict)
 adds all synthDescs in a path to a dict 

 SynthDescs are created by SynthDescLib, by reading a compiled synth def file.

 SynthDescLib.global.read("synthdefs/default.scsyndef");
 SynthDescLib.global.synthDescs.at(\default)

name returns the name of the SynthDef
 controlNames returns an array of instances of ControlName, each of which 
 have the following fields: name, index, rate, defaultValue
 
 SynthDescLib.global.synthDescs.at(\default).controlNames.postln;
 
hasGate is true if the Synthdef has a gate input
msgFunc the function which is used to create an array of arguments for
 playing a synth def in patterns
 
 SynthDescLib.global.synthDescs.at(\default).msgFunc.postcs;

SynthDescs are needed by the event stream system, so when using Pbind and NotePlayer,
the instruments' default parameters are derived from the SynthDesc.


aSynthDef.store also creates a synthDesc in the global library:


 (
 SynthDef("test", { arg out, freq, xFade; 
 XOut.ar(out, xFade, SinOsc.ar(freq)) 
 }).store
 );

 SynthDescLib.global.browse; // browse the properties of SynthDescs
