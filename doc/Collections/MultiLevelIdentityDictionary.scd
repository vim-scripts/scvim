MultiLevelIdentityDictionary

superclass: Collection

A tree of IdentityDictionaries. Addresses within the tree are specified with a series of keys. Library is its most useful subclass.


at(key1,key2 ... keyN)
 retrieves a leaf node or nil if not found.
 
put(key1,key2 ... keyN, item)
 puts the item as a leaf node, internally creating new branches as needed to accommodate the list of keys.
 
choose
 choose a branch at each level, descend the tree until a leaf is chosen.
 
choose(key1,key2 ... keyN)
 starting at an address within the tree, descend the tree until a leaf is chosen.
 
putTree(key1,[
 key2a, item1-2a,
 key2b, item1-2b,
 [
 key3, item1-3
 ] // etc...
 ]);
 
 A way to insert objects into the tree with a syntax similar to the organization of the tree
 itself.
