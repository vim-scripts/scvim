ZeroCrossing zero crossing frequency follower

ZeroCrossing.ar(in)

Outputs a frequency based upon the distance between interceptions of the X axis. The X intercepts are determined via linear interpolation so this gives better than just integer wavelength resolution. This is a very crude pitch follower, but can be useful in some situations.

in - input signal.
