IFFT		Inverse Fast Fourier Transform

The inverse fast fourier transform converts from frequency content to a signal. See also FFT Overview.

	IFFT(buffer)

s = Server.local;

b = Buffer.alloc(s,2048,1);


SynthDef("help-noopFFT", { arg out=0,bufnum=0;
	var in, chain;
	in = WhiteNoise.ar(0.01);
	chain = FFT(bufnum, in);
	chain.inspect; // its an FFT
	Out.ar(out,
		IFFT(chain) // inverse FFT
	);
}).play(s,[\out,0,\bufnum,b.bufnum]);

See FFT for more examples.

The window used is a Welch window by default. The optional wintype argument to IFFT can change this, in the same way as for FFT.
