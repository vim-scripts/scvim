OutputProxy output place holder

Superclass: UGen

OutputProxy is used by some UGens as a place holder for multiple outputs.
There is no reason for a user to create an OutputProxy directly.

(
var out;
// Pan2 uses an OutputProxy for each of its two outputs.
out = Pan2.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, 0.0); 
out.postln;
)

Methods:

source 

Get the UGen that is the source for this OutputProxy.

(
var left, right;
// Pan2 uses an OutputProxy for each of its two outputs.
# left, right = Pan2.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, 0.0); 
left.source.postln;
)

The source method is also defined in Array, so that the source can be obtained this way as well:

(
var out;
// Pan2 uses an OutputProxy for each of its two outputs.
out = Pan2.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, 0.0); 
out.postln;
out.source.postln;
)
