Fold fold a signal outside given thresholds

Fold.ar(in, lo, hi)
Fold.kr(in, lo, hi)

This differs from the BinaryOpUGenfold2 in that it allows one to set both low and high thresholds.
in - signal to be folded
lo - low threshold of folding. Sample values < lo will be folded.
hi - high threshold of folding. Sample values > hi will be folded.
