BiPanB2 2D Ambisonic B-format panner

BiPanB2.kr(inA, inB, azimuth, gain)

Encode a two channel signal to two dimensional ambisonic B-format.
This puts two channels at opposite poles of a 2D ambisonic field.
This is one way to map a stereo sound onto a soundfield.
It is equivalent to:

PanB2(inA, azimuth, gain) + PanB2(inB, azimuth + 1, gain)

inA - input signal A
inB - input signal B
azimuth - position around the circle from -1 to +1. 
-1 is behind, -0.5 is left, 0 is forward, +0.5 is right, +1 is behind.
gain - amplitude control
