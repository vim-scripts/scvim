ReplaceOut		send signal to a bus, overwriting previous contents

superclass: Out

*ar(bus, channelsArray) - write a signal to an audio bus.
*kr(bus, channelsArray) - write a signal to a control bus.
	
bus - the index of the bus to write out to. The lowest numbers are written to the audio hardware.
channelsArray - an Array of channels or single output to write out. You cannot change the size of this once a SynthDef has been built.
		
Out adds it's output to a given bus, making it available to all nodes later in the node tree. (See Synth and Order-of-execution for more information.) ReplaceOut overwrites those contents. This can make it useful for processing.

See the Server-Architecture and Bus helpfiles for more information on buses and how they are used.
