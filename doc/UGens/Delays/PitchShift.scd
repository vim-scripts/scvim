PitchShift

PitchShift.ar(in, windowSize, pitchRatio, pitchDispersion, timeDispersion, mul, add)

A time domain granular pitch shifter.
Grains have a triangular amplitude envelope and an overlap of 4:1.
in - the input signal.
windowSize - the size of the grain window in seconds. This value cannot be modulated.
pitchRatio - the ratio of the pitch shift. Must be from 0.0 to 4.0.
pitchDispersion - the maximum random deviation of the pitch from the pitchRatio.
timeDispersion - a random offset of from zero to timeDispersion seconds is added to the delay
of each grain. Use of some dispersion can alleviate a hard comb filter effect due to uniform
grain placement. It can also be an effect in itself. timeDispersion can be no larger than windowSize.
