AllpassN all pass delay line with no interpolation

AllpassN.ar(in, maxdelaytime, delaytime, decaytime, mul, add)
AllpassN.kr(in, maxdelaytime, delaytime, decaytime, mul, add)

All pass delay line with no interpolation. See also [AllpassC] which uses cubic interpolation, and [AllpassL] which uses linear interpolation. Cubic interpolation is more computationally expensive than linear, but more accurate.

See also [BufAllpassN].

in - the input signal.
maxdelaytime - the maximum delay time in seconds. used to initialize the delay buffer size.
delaytime - delay time in seconds.
decaytime - time for the echoes to decay by 60 decibels. If this time is negative then the feedback
coefficient will be negative, thus emphasizing only odd harmonics at an octave lower.

// Since the allpass delay has no audible effect as a resonator on
// steady state sound ... 

{ AllpassC.ar(WhiteNoise.ar(0.1), 0.01, XLine.kr(0.0001, 0.01, 20), 0.2) }.play;

// ...these examples add the input to the effected sound and compare variants so that you can hear
// the effect of the phase comb:

(
{
 z = WhiteNoise.ar(0.2);
 z + AllpassN.ar(z, 0.01, XLine.kr(0.0001, 0.01, 20), 0.2)
}.play)

(
{
 z = WhiteNoise.ar(0.2);
 z + AllpassL.ar(z, 0.01, XLine.kr(0.0001, 0.01, 20), 0.2)
}.play)

(
{
 z = WhiteNoise.ar(0.2);
 z + AllpassC.ar(z, 0.01, XLine.kr(0.0001, 0.01, 20), 0.2)
}.play)

// used as an echo - doesn't really sound different than Comb,
// but it outputs the input signal immediately (inverted) and the echoes
// are lower in amplitude.
{ AllpassN.ar(Decay.ar(Dust.ar(1,0.5), 0.2, WhiteNoise.ar), 0.2, 0.2, 3) }.play;
