Slew slew rate limiter

Slew.ar(in, upSlope, downSlope, mul, add)

Limits the slope of an input signal. The slope is expressed in units per second.
in - input signal.
upSlope - maximum upward slope.
downSlope - maximum downward slope.


(
{
 z = LFPulse.ar(800);
 [z, Slew.ar(z, 4000, 4000)]
}.plot)



Has the effect of removing transients and higher frequencies.
