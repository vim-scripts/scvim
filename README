Hi, these are my supercollider interaction scripts and syntax highlighting for vim.

It works on both linux and osx.

So far I have:

    * Syntax Highlighting
    * The ability to single lines, visual blocks or supercollider blocks (ie surrounded by parens) to sclang
    * key bindings for s.freeAll, thisProcess.stop() [cmd-. in the SC editor], TempoClock.clear()
    * In-line Help
    * In-line Class Look-up
